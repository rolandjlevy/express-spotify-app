### To do
- List out tracks of each album using the endpoint /albumtracks/:albumId'
  Each track object comes with a preview_url, which is the source for a 30 second preview of a particular song. You can plug this into an HTML audio tag, and it will play the preview. Use the
  spotifyApi.getAlbumTracks() method
- implement ejs templates
- styling

### Done
- add express router
- sort out confusion with albums rendering vs albums data link
